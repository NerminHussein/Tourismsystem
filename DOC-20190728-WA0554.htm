<h2> 1. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giza_pyramid_complex"  target="_blank" title="Go to Wikipedia" >The Pyramids and Sphinx. </a> </h2>


<p> 
The last surviving of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, The Giza pyramid complex,<br>
 also called the Giza Necropolis, is the site on the Giza Plateau in Egypt that includes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giza_pyramid_complex#Khufu's_pyramid_complex"  target="_blank" title="Go to Wikipedia" >the Great Pyramid of Giza</a>,<br>
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giza_pyramid_complex#Khafre's_pyramid_complex" target="_blank" title="Go to Wikipedia" >Pyramid of Khafre</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giza_pyramid_complex#Menkaure's_pyramid_complex"  target="_blank" title="Go to Wikipedia" >the Pyramid of Menkaure</a>,
 along with their associated pyramid complexes and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giza_pyramid_complex#Sphinx" target="_blank" title="Go to Wikipedia" > the Great Sphinx of Giza</a>. <br> <br> All were built during the Fourth Dynasty of the Old Kingdom of Ancient Egypt.<br>
 The site also includes several cemeteries and the remains of a workers' village.

<br>
<h2> 2. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_Museum" target="_blank" title="Go to Wikipedia" > The Egyptian Museum. </a> </h2>
<p> Museum of Cairo, is home to an extensive collection of ancient Egyptian antiquities. It has 120,000 items,<br>
 with a representative amount on display, the remainder in storerooms.<br>
 Built in 1901 by the Italian construction company Garozzo-Zaffarani, the edifice is one of the largest museums in the region. <br> <br>There are two main floors in the museum, the ground floor and the first floor. <br>On the ground floor there is an extensive collection of papyrus and coins used in the Ancient world. <br>
On the first floor there are artifacts from the final two dynasties of Egypt, including items from the tombs of the Pharaohs. </p>
<br>

<h2> 3. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnak"target="_blank" title="Go to Wikipedia">Luxor's Karnak Temple </a> and   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valley_of_the_Kings"target="_blank" title="Go to Wikipedia">The Valley of the Kings. </a> </h2>
<p> Famed for the Valley of the Kings, Karnak Temple, and the Memorial Temple of Hatshepsut, <br>
the Nile-side town of Luxor in Upper Egypt has a glut of tourist attractions. This is ancient Thebes,<br>
 power base of the New Kingdom pharaohs, and home to more sights than most can see on one visit. <br> <br>
While the East Bank brims with vibrant souk action, the quieter West Bank is home to a bundle of tombs and<br>
 temples that has been called the biggest open-air museum in the world. <br> 
<br> Spend a few days here exploring the colorful wall art of the tombs and gazing in awe at the colossal columns in the temples,<br>
 and you'll see why Luxor continues to fascinate historians and archaeologists.
</p>

<br>
<h2>4. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Cairo"target="_blank" title="Go to Wikipedia">Islamic Cairo. </a> </h2>
<p> The atmospheric, narrow lanes of the capital's Islamic Cairo district are crammed full of mosques,<br>
 madrassas (Islamic schools of learning), and monuments dating from the Fatimid through to the Mameluke eras.<br>
 This is where you'll find the labyrinth shopping souk of Khan el-Khalili, where coppersmiths and artisans still have their tiny workshops,<br>
 and stalls are laden with ceramics, textiles, spice, and perfume.Surrounding the market is a muddle of roads,<br>
 home to some of the most beautiful preserved architecture of the old Islamic empires.<br> <br>
 There is a wealth of history here to explore.<br> 
 Visit Al-Azhar Mosque and the dazzling Sultan Hassan Mosque,and make sure you climb<br> to the roof of the ancient medieval gate of Bab Zuweila for the best minaret-speckled panoramas across the district. </p> 
<br>

<h2>5. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aswan"target="_blank" title="Go to Wikipedia">Aswan. </a> </h2>
<p> Egypt's most tranquil town is Aswan, set upon the winding curves of the Nile.<br>
 Backed by orange-hued dunes, this is the pesrfect place to stop and unwind for a few days and soak up the chilled-out atmosphere.<br><br> 
Take the river ferry across to Elephantine Island and stroll the colorful streets of the Nubian villages.<br>
 Ride a camel to the desert monastery of St.Simeon on the East Bank.<br>
 Or just drink endless cups of tea on one of the riverboat restaurants,<br>
 while watching the lateen-sailed feluccas drift past.<br><br>
There are plenty of historic sites here and numerous temples nearby,<br>
 but one of Aswan's most popular things to do is simply kicking back and watching the river life go by.
</p>

<br>
<h2>6. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Simbel_temples"target="_blank" title="Go to Wikipedia"> Abu Simbel. </a> </h2>
<p>Even in a country festooned with temples, Abu Simbel is something special.<br>
 This is Ramses II's great temple, adorned with colossal statuary standing guard outside,<br>
 and with an interior sumptuously decorated with wall paintings.<br><br> 
Justly famous for its megalithic proportions, Abu Simbel is also known for the incredible feat,<br>
 which saw the entire temple moved from its original setting — set to disappear under the water because of <br>
the Aswan dam — during the 1960s in a massive UNESCO operation that took four years.
</p>

<br>
<h2>7. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farafra,_Egypt#White_Desert"target="_blank" title="Go to Wikipedia">White Desert. </a> </h2>
<p>Egypt's kookiest natural wonder is the White Desert, 
where surreally shaped chalk mountains have created what looks like <br>
a snowy wonderland in the middle of the arid sand.<br><br>
 The landscapes here look like something out of a science fiction movie, <br>
with blindingly white boulders and iceberg-like pinnacles.<br><br>
 For desert fans and adventurers, this is the ultimate weird playground,<br>
 while anybody who's had their fill of temples and tombs will enjoy this spectacular natural scenery.<br>
</p>
<img src="" >
<br>
<h2>8. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siwa_Oasis"target="_blank" title="Go to Wikipedia"> Siwa Oasis. </a></h2>
<p>Way out west, Siwa is the tranquil tonic to the hustle of Egypt's cities.<br><br> 
This gorgeous little oasis, surrounded by date palm plantations and numerous fresh water springs,<br>
 is one of the Western Desert's most picturesque spots.<br> 
The town is centered around the ruins of a vast mud-brick citadel that dominates the view.<br><br>
 This is a top spot to wind down and go slow for a few days,<br>
as well as being an excellent base from which to plan adventures into the surrounding desert.
</p>
<br>
<h2>9. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria"target="_blank" title="Go to Wikipedia"> Alexandria. </a></h2>
<p>The most European of Egypt's cities, Alexandria has a history that not many others can match.<br>
 Founded by Alexander the Great, home of Cleopatra, and razzmatazz renegade city of the Mediterranean for much of its life,<br>
 this seaside city has an appealing days-gone-by atmosphere that can't be beaten.<br><br>
 Although today, there are few historic remnants of its illustrious past — feted in songs and books —<br>
 this is a place made for aimless strolling along the seashore Corniche, café-hopping, and souk shopping.
</p>
<br>
<h2>10. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Catherine%27s_Monastery"target="_blank" title="Go to Wikipedia"> St. Catherine's Monastery. </a></h2>
<p>One of the oldest monasteries in the world, St. Catherine's stands at the foot of Mount Sinai,<br>
 where Moses is said to have received the Ten Commandments.<br><br> 
This desert monastery is home to an incredible collection of religious iconography, art,<br>
 and manuscripts (some of which can be seen in the on-site museum), as well as the burning bush.<br><br>
 For most visitors here, a trip to St. Catherine's also involves a hike up Mount Sinai to see sunrise or sunset.<br>
 Take the camel path for the easy route or climb the famous Steps of Repentance if you want better views.
</p>
<br>
<h2>11. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Sinai_Governorate"target="_blank" title="Go to Wikipedia"> South Sinai.</a></h2>
<p>Egypt's center for beach fun is the South Sinai region on the Sinai Peninsula.<br>
 Sharm el-Sheikh is a European-style resort full of luxury hotels, international restaurants, and bags of entertainment options.<br>
 Dahab is a low-key beach town with a budget-traveler heart, which is just as much about desert excursions and adventures as the sea.<br><br>
Up the coast, between the port town of Nuweiba and the border town of Taba,<br>
 are the bamboo hut retreats that offer complete get-away-from-it-all respites from life.<br>
 Wherever you choose, the South Sinai is all about diving.<br> 
The Red Sea is one of the top diving destinations in the world, and the South Sinai region is home to most of the best dive sites.
</p>
<br>
<h2>12. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abydos,_Egypt#Temple_of_Seti_I"target="_blank" title="Go to Wikipedia"> Abydos Temple.</a></h2>
<p>Dusty Abydos town wouldn't make much of a rating on the tourism radar if it wasn't for the incredible temple on its doorstep.<br><br>
 Abydos' Temple of Osiris is one of ancient Egypt's most fascinating artistic treasures.<br>
 Its chunky columns and walls, covered in beautiful hieroglyphics and intricate paintings,<br>
 are spellbinding sights, and even better, you can admire them without the crowds as despite its dazzling beauty,<br>
it receives few visitors compared to the temples in nearby Luxor.
</p>
<br>
<h2>13. Thistlegorm Dive Site.</h2>
<p>Below the Red Sea's surface is another world as fascinating as the temples and tombs on land.<br>
 Among the many coral reefs off the coast there's also a glut of shipwrecks<br>
 that have sunk in the Red Sea's Gulf of Gubal and Gulf of Aqaba. Of all the wrecks,<br>
 the most famous is the Thistlegorm, an English WWII cargo ship <br>
that was on its way to resupply British troops when it was bombed by the Germans in 1941.<br><br>
Today the site is regarded by divers as one of the top five wreck dives in the world due to the vast cargo of cars,<br>
 motorbikes, and WWII memorabilia that can be seen both scattered on the sea bed around the wreck and inside the ship itself.<br><br>
 Dive boat trips to the wreck are organized from both Sharm el-Sheikh and Hurghada.
</p>
<br>
<h2>14. Nile Cruising.</h2>
<p>Egypt is defined by the Nile.<br> For many visitors a multi-day cruise upon this famed waterway that saw the rise of the Pharaonic era is a highlight of their Egypt trip.<br><br> 
Cruising the Nile is also the most relaxing way to see the temples that stud the banks of the river on the route between Luxor and Aswan,<br>
plus sunrise and sunset over the date-palm-studded river banks, backed by sand dunes, is one of Egypt's most tranquil vistas.<br><br>
The two famous sights on a Nile Cruise are the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Kom_Ombo"target="_blank" title="Go to Wikipedia"> Temple of Kom Ombo</a>  and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Edfu"target="_blank" title="Go to Wikipedia"> Edfu's Temple of Horus</a>, where all the big cruise boats stop.<br><br>
If you'd prefer a less crowded and slower experience though, and don't mind "roughing it" a bit, <br>
you can also cruise the Nile by felucca (Egypt's traditional lateen-sailed wooden boats), which also allows you to create your own itinerary.<br><br>
 Cruise boats depart from both Luxor and Aswan, but feluccas can only be chartered for multi-day trips from Aswan.

<br>
<h2>15. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saqqara"target="_blank" title="Go to Wikipedia">Saqqara </a> </h2>
<p>Everyone's heard of Giza's Pyramids, but they're not the only pyramids Egypt has up its sleeve.<br>
 Day-tripping from Cairo, Saqqara is the vast necropolis of the Old Kingdom pharaohs and showcases<br>
 how the Ancient Egyptians advanced their architectural knowledge to finally create a true pyramid with the Step Pyramid,<br>
 Bent Pyramid, and Red Pyramid being among the highlights here.<br><br>
 The various tombs of court administrators, with interior walls covered with friezes describing daily scenes, <br>
scattered throughout the archaeological site are just as much a reason to visit as the pyramids themselves.
