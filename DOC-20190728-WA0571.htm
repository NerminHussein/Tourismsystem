<h2>1-Christ Redeemer</h2>

<figcaption>Christ Redeemer</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Christ the Redeemer was bulit using re-inforced concrete and has an outer shell of 6 million soapstone tiles . it's believed that the workers who made these tiles
occasionally wrote notes on the back, meaning this iconic landmark is full of hidden messages.Due to the statue's mountaintop position,
it's prone to light-ning strikes and gets hit around three to six times a year.Prior to the FIFA World Cup in 2014,lightning struck and broke one of the statue's thumbs.
The original design of the statue was different to what we see today . it was intended for Christto be holding a globe in one hand and a cross in the other,
rather than two open arms. Christ the Redeemer was not actually built in Brazil. it was first made in France by French sculptor Paul Landowski Who created the statue in clay pieces.
These were then shipped to Brazil to be remade with reinforced concrete by Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva Costa and French engineer Albert Caquot. 
The statue boasts an impressive title. In 2007 it was voted one of the New Seven Wonders of the World alongside top Sights such as the Great Wall of China,
Machu Picchu and the Rose City of Petra.</p>

<h2>2-Sugar Loaf Rio de Janeiro</h2>

<figcaption>Sugar Loaf Rio de Janeiro</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The easily recognized emblem of Rio de Janeiro, the rounded rock peak of Sugar Loaf juts out of a tree-covered promontory,
rising 394 meters above the beaches and city. Its summit is one of the first places tourists go, for views of Rio and the harbor,
and for the thrill of riding suspended in a cable car between Sugar Loaf and the Morro da Urca, a lower peak from which a second cableway connects to the city.
Rio's first settlement began below these peaks, near the long Praia da Urca beach, and you can tour one of the three early forts there, the star-shaped Fort Sao Joao.</p>

<h2 >3-Iguacu Falls</h2>
<br>
<figure>
<img src="8.jpg" alt="Iguaçu Falls" width="370" height="300">
<figcaption>Iguacu Falls</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>At the point where Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina meet, the Iguacu river drops spectacularly in a semicircle of 247 waterfalls that thunder down into the gorge below.
 Just above the falls, the river is constricted to one-fourth of its usual width, making the force of the water even stronger.
 Some of the falls are more than 100 meters high and they cover such a broad area that you'll never see all of them at once, but you do get the broadest panorama from the Brazilian side.
 Catwalks and a tower give you different perspectives, and one bridge reaches all the way to one of the largest, known as the Garganta do Diabo (Devil's Throat). 
You can cross to the Argentinian side for closer views from catwalks that extend farther into the center of the falls. The two sides offer different perspectives and views,
 so most tourists plan to see both. The falls are protected by the UNESCO-acclaimed Iguacu National Park,
 where subtropical rain forests are the home to more than 1,000 species of birds and mammals, including deer, otters, ocelots, and capybaras.</p>

<h2>4-Amazon Rain Forests</h2>

<figcaption>Amazon Rain Forests</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>About 20 kilometers southeast of Manaus, the dark Rio Negro waters meet the light muddy water of the Rio Solimões,
flowing side by side for about six kilometers before mixing as the Amazon. Boat trips from Manaus take you to this point, called Encontro das Aguas,
meeting of the waters. Other boat trips take you into the heart of the rain forests and the network of rivers, channels, and lakes formed by the three rivers.
In the Rio Negro, the Anavilhanas Islands form an archipelago with lakes, streams, and flooded forests that offer a full cross-section of the Amazonian ecosystem.
You can see monkeys, sloths, parrots, toucans, caimans, turtles, and other wildlife on a boat trip here. Also close to Manaus,
the 688-hectare Janauari Ecological Park has a number of different ecosystems that you can explore by boat along its narrow waterways.
An entire lake here is covered with giant water-lilies found only in the Amazon region. While in Manaus, be sure to see its famous Teatro Amazonas,
the Italian Renaissance-style opera house, designed to put Manaus on the map as South America's great center of culture.</p>

<p>São Paulo holds some of the best collections of fine arts in Latin America, and the buildings in which they are housed are architectural landmarks as well.
The Museu de Arte, MASP, displays the continent's most comprehensive collection of western art, with representative works by artists from the Renaissance through modern masters.
There are 73 bronze sculptures by Degas and works by Renoir, Manet, Van Gogh, Matisse, Picasso, and Miró. From its beginning, the museum has concentrated on works of mid- to late-20th-century artists,
and the building designed by architect Lina Bo Bardi is a Modernist landmark. Oscar Niemeyer designed the Pavilhão da Bienal de Artes in Ibirapuera Park, home to the Museu de Arte Contemporânea.
More than 8,000 works of art - one of Latin America's largest collections of 20th- century Western artists - includes Picasso, Chagall, Kandinsky, Miró,
and Modigliani along with major Brazilian painters. Set above Versailles-inspired formal gardens, Museu do Ipirangahouses paintings and decorative arts.</p>

<p>On the north side of the city center, the large Parque Municipal is a green space with dozens of century-old shade trees, a lake with boat rides, several gardens, children's playgrounds,
tennis courts, aviaries, and a theater. An Orchidarium has greenhouses filled with rare orchid varieties. From May through September, the Orchestra of Minas Gerais performs a Concerto no Parque every Sunday morning.
The park is a lovely place to stroll or picnic, close to the main attractions of the city.</p>

<h2>7-Ouro Preto</h2>

<figcaption>Ouro Preto</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The wealth of Brazil's state of Minas Gerais in its glory days of the colonial period is easy to imagine from the interiors of the churches in its old capital, Ouro Preto. Entire walls are washed in gold that flowed - along with diamonds - from the mines surrounding the city in the 17th and 18th centuries. Cascading down the sides of a steep valley and surrounded by mountains, Ouro Preto is a jewel of a colonial town, but its steep narrow streets and mountain setting - however captivating for tourists today - didn't meet the needs of a growing provincial capital. The government moved to the newly built capital of Belo Horizonte, leaving Ouro Preto in its time capsule. The 17th-century Baroque and Rococo churches of São Francisco de Assis and Matriz de Nossa Senhora do Pilar are the best examples, but the entire town is so rich in colonial architecture that Ouro Preto has been named a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The steep streets, so precipitous in places that they become stairways, are lined by gracious colonial mansions, and white churches crown its hills with Baroque bell towers.</p>

<h2>8-Brasília's Modernist Architecture</h2>

</figure>

<p>Brazil's new city of Brasília was carved out of the wilderness and completed in less than three years to replace Rio de Janeiro as the country's capital in 1960. The ambitious plan by Lúcio Costa and Oscar Niemeyer became a showpiece of city planning and avant-garde architecture, and it remains today as one of the world's few cities that represent a completed plan and a single architectural concept. Without the normal mix of residential and business districts, the entire governmental section is composed of major architectural highlights, which are the city's main tourist attractions. Some of the most striking surround Praça dos Tràs Poderes: the presidential palace, supreme court, and the two sharply contrasting congress buildings, plus the Historical Museum of Brasília and the Panteão da Liberdade (Pantheon of Freedom), designed by Oscar Niemeyer. That architect's best-known building in the city is the circular Catedral Metropolitana Nossa Senhora Aparecida, whose curved concrete columns rise to support a glass roof. Another of Niemeyer's landmark works is the Palácio dos Arcos, surrounded by beautiful gardens designed by Brazilian landscape architect Roberto Burle Marx, who worked with Niemeyer on several projects throughout Brazil. The round Memorial dos Povos Indígenas (Museum of Indigenous People) is patterned after a traditional Yanomamö round house. But many consider Niemeyer's finest work to be the Monumento JK, a memorial to President Juscelino Kubitschek, the founder of Brasilia. Brasilia has been named a UNESCO World Heritage city.</p>

<figcaption>Copacabana, Rio de Janeiro</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Downtown Rio's most fashionable and famous section follows Avenida Nossa Senhora de Copacabana and is bordered all along one side by four kilometers of white sand and breaking surf. The beach is separated from the buildings and traffic by a broad promenade paved in black and white mosaic in an undulating pattern reminiscent of streets in Lisbon, Portugal. The beach isn't just for show. It's also a popular playground filled with sun-worshipers, swimmers, and kids building sand castles whenever the weather is fine. Stroll the streets here to find restaurants, smart shops, cafés, and beautiful old buildings from the days when Rio was Brazil's capital. One of these, the famed Copacabana Palace, is protected as a national monument. Inside its lobby, you can easily imagine seeing the royalty and film idols who have stayed here.</p>

<figcaption>Salvador's Pelourinho</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The Cidade Alta (Upper Town) of Brazil's former colonial capital has been named a UNESCO World Heritage site for its exceptional collection of 17th- and 18th-century colonial buildings, the finest such ensemble in South America. Called the Pelourinho, this old quarter is where you'll find Salvador's most beautiful churches and monasteries, built at a time when Brazil was the source of Portugal's riches, and the plentiful gold was lavished on the colony's religious buildings. The finest and most opulent of the city's churches is São Francisco, built in the early 1700s and filled with intricate carvings covered in gold. In the choir and cloister, you can see excellent examples of Portuguese tile panels, called azulejos. This was the friary church, and next to it is the church of the Franciscan Third Order. It's impossible to miss the riotously carved façade covered in statues and intricate decoration. The interior is just as ornate, surpassing even the Portuguese Baroque in its opulent detail.</p>
