<h2 >Iguaçu Falls</h2>
<p>At the point where Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina meet, the Iguaçu river drops spectacularly in a semicircle of 247 waterfalls that thunder down into the gorge below.
 Just above the falls, the river is constricted to one-fourth of its usual width, making the force of the water even stronger.
 Some of the falls are more than 100 meters high and they cover such a broad area that you'll never see all of them at once, but you do get the broadest panorama from the Brazilian side.
 Catwalks and a tower give you different perspectives, and one bridge reaches all the way to one of the largest, known as the Garganta do Diabo (Devil's Throat). 
You can cross to the Argentinian side for closer views from catwalks that extend farther into the center of the falls. The two sides offer different perspectives and views,
 so most tourists plan to see both. The falls are protected by the UNESCO-acclaimed Iguaçu National Park,
 where subtropical rain forests are the home to more than 1,000 species of birds and mammals, including deer, otters, ocelots, and capybaras.</p>

<h2>Amazon Rain Forests</h2>
<p>About 20 kilometers southeast of Manaus, the dark Rio Negro waters meet the light muddy water of the Rio Solimões,
flowing side by side for about six kilometers before mixing as the Amazon. Boat trips from Manaus take you to this point, called Encontro das Aguas,
meeting of the waters. Other boat trips take you into the heart of the rain forests and the network of rivers, channels, and lakes formed by the three rivers.
In the Rio Negro, the Anavilhanas Islands form an archipelago with lakes, streams, and flooded forests that offer a full cross-section of the Amazonian ecosystem.
You can see monkeys, sloths, parrots, toucans, caimans, turtles, and other wildlife on a boat trip here. Also close to Manaus,
the 688-hectare Janauari Ecological Park has a number of different ecosystems that you can explore by boat along its narrow waterways.
An entire lake here is covered with giant water-lilies found only in the Amazon region. While in Manaus, be sure to see its famous Teatro Amazonas,
the Italian Renaissance-style opera house, designed to put Manaus on the map as South America's great center of culture.</p>

<h2>Art Museums of Sao Paulo</h2>
<p>São Paulo holds some of the best collections of fine arts in Latin America, and the buildings in which they are housed are architectural landmarks as well.
The Museu de Arte, MASP, displays the continent's most comprehensive collection of western art, with representative works by artists from the Renaissance through modern masters.
There are 73 bronze sculptures by Degas and works by Renoir, Manet, Van Gogh, Matisse, Picasso, and Miró. From its beginning, the museum has concentrated on works of mid- to late-20th-century artists,
and the building designed by architect Lina Bo Bardi is a Modernist landmark. Oscar Niemeyer designed the Pavilhão da Bienal de Artes in Ibirapuera Park, home to the Museu de Arte Contemporânea.
More than 8,000 works of art - one of Latin America's largest collections of 20th- century Western artists - includes Picasso, Chagall, Kandinsky, Miró,
and Modigliani along with major Brazilian painters. Set above Versailles-inspired formal gardens, Museu do Ipirangahouses paintings and decorative arts.</p>

<h2> Parque Municipal (City Park)</h2>
<p>On the north side of the city center, the large Parque Municipal is a green space with dozens of century-old shade trees, a lake with boat rides, several gardens, children's playgrounds,
tennis courts, aviaries, and a theater. An Orchidarium has greenhouses filled with rare orchid varieties. From May through September, the Orchestra of Minas Gerais performs a Concerto no Parque every Sunday morning.
The park is a lovely place to stroll or picnic, close to the main attractions of the city.</p>
